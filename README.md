# CasFlow

This repo provides a reference implementation of **CasFlow** as described in the paper:
> CasFlow: Exploring Hierarchical Structures and Propagation Uncertainty for Cascade Prediction.  
> Fan Zhou, Xovee Xu, Kunpeng Zhang, Siyuan Liu and Goce Trajcevski.  
> Submitted for publication.

## Basic Usage

### Requirements

The code was tested with Python 3.7, `tensorflow-gpu` 2.0.0a and Cuda 10.0. Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the code
```shell
> cd casflow
> python gene_cascade.py
> python preprocessing.py
> python casflow.py
```

### Run code in Google Colab

You can also run the code in [Google Golab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19zQrAIo-yyfkH8m95UmdepzSryxHHs_a?usp=sharing). 

#### Options
You may change the model settings manually in `config.py` or directly into the codes. 

#### Datasets

See some sample cascades in `./datasets/datasets.txt`.
